# Downloads & Reference Library

Guides, templates, and reference documents from my actual setup. Download, adapt, and use freely.

## Start Here If

Use this page when you want longer-form reference material, concrete templates, or real working examples that sit beside the main workflow docs.

If you are brand new to the site, start with [Quickstart](../quickstart.md), [Skill Library](../setup/skill-reference.md), or [Examples](../examples/index.md) first. Come back here when you want deeper supporting material.

**A note on dates:** AI tools evolve fast. Each resource includes a date so you know how current it is. I'll update these periodically, but always check official documentation for the latest on any specific tool.

## Best First Picks

If you only open three things, start with:

- [A Real CLAUDE.md — Annotated](real-claude-md-example.md) for a concrete working example
- [Skill Design Patterns](skill-patterns.md) for reusable build ideas
- [Tool Limitations & When to Use What](tool-limitations.md) for decision support across tools
